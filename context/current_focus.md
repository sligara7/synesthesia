# Current Focus

## System: Synesthesia
## Workflow: 00a-basic_setup
## Current Step: S-03 - Foundational Documents

### What We're Doing
Completing basic setup workflow for the Synesthesia project - a cross-domain structural analysis service that finds resonances between graphs from different domains (images, music, text) based on topological structure.

### Completed
- S-01: Path configuration - all paths stored in working_memory.json
- S-02: Directory structure created (context/, specs/, services/)
- S-03-A01: SYSTEM_MISSION_STATEMENT.md created
- S-03-A02: USER_SCENARIOS.md created
- S-03-A03: SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md created
- S-03-A03A: Stakeholder approval preference set (No - personal project)
- S-03-A04: working_memory.json initialized

### Next Actions
- S-03-A06: Configure git automation
- Complete S-03 and move to approach detection (01a)
- Then proceed to functional analysis (01d) since we have detailed functional requirements

### Key Decisions
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Disabled (personal/hobby project)
- **Git Automation**: Enabled

### Notes
The project already has existing Python implementation in src/structural_rorschach/. Approach detection will likely identify this as bottom-up or hybrid approach.
