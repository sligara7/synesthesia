# System Mission Statement
## Synesthesia: Structural Rorschach Cross-Domain Analysis Service

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2024

---

## Purpose

Synesthesia is a cross-domain structural analysis service that discovers "resonances" between graphs from different domains (images, music, text, code) based on their **topological structure** rather than semantic content.

The core insight: **Structure is meaning**. A flower's radial petal arrangement might resonate with a musical chord's harmonic structure - not because flowers and chords share meaning, but because they share *shape*.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Domain-Agnostic Graph Representation**: Convert any structured data (text, images, music, code) into unified graph representations that preserve structural properties while stripping domain-specific semantics.

2. **Structural Signature Extraction**: Extract comprehensive, comparable signatures from graphs including degree patterns, clustering metrics, flow properties, motif frequencies, centrality measures, and spectral properties.

3. **Cross-Domain Resonance Finding**: Enable discovery of structurally similar patterns across completely different domains - "show me an image, and I'll tell you what it sounds like."

4. **Interpretable Explanations**: Provide human-readable explanations for why two structures resonate, making cross-domain insights accessible to non-technical users.

## Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Researchers** | Discover hidden patterns across disciplines |
| **Educators** | Present information in formats matching cognitive styles |
| **Artists/Musicians** | Find structural inspiration across media |
| **Data Scientists** | Novel approach to cross-domain feature engineering |
| **Accessibility Advocates** | Enable multi-modal information presentation |

## Success Criteria (High Level)

1. Cross-domain matching works reliably between text, image, and music domains
2. Resonance explanations are interpretable by non-technical users
3. Signature extraction completes in < 30s for graphs up to 10,000 nodes
4. Similarity computation completes in < 100ms
5. System integrates with existing graph analysis workflows

## Vision

*"What sometimes is difficult to understand in one domain becomes immediately clear in another domain to see."*

Synesthesia enables different doors to the same truth - presenting information in formats that work best for each person's cognitive style, unlocking insights invisible in traditional single-domain representations.
