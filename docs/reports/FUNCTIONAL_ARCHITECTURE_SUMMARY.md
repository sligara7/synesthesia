## Existing Implementation Mapping

The project has existing Python implementation (~2,660 lines):

| Existing File | Maps To Functions |
|---------------|-------------------|
| signature.py | F-SE-01 (StructuralSignature dataclass) |
| extractor.py | F-SE-02 to F-SE-07 (SignatureExtractor) |
| motifs.py | F-MD-01 to F-MD-07 (MotifDetector) |
| spectral.py | F-SE-07 (SpectralSignature) |
| pruning.py | F-GU-03 (GraphPruner) |
| cli.py | Entry point wrapper |

### Implementation Gaps
Functions **not yet implemented** in existing code:
- F-DA-01 to F-DA-04 (Domain Adapters)
- F-SC-01 to F-SC-04 (Similarity Computation)
- F-RF-01, F-RF-02, F-RF-04 (Resonance Finding)
- F-IE-01 to F-IE-03 (Interpretation Engine)
- F-CM-01 to F-CM-06 (Corpus Management)

---

## Next Steps

**Option A: Continue to Service Allocation**
- Run `01b-bottom_up_integration` to allocate functions to services
- Map existing implementation to service architecture

**Option B: Continue to Development Implementation**
- Run `03a-development_implementation` to implement missing functions
- Use functional architecture as development guide

**Option C: Stop Here (Architecture-Only)**
- Functional architecture is complete and validated
- Deliver to stakeholders for review

---

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Domain Adapters First** - These are entry points and enable testing
2. **Add Corpus Management** - Required for resonance finding
3. **Build Similarity + Resonance Finding** - Core cross-domain functionality
4. **Add Interpretation Engine Last** - Depends on other components
